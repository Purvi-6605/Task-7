# Task-7 : Support Vector Machines (SVM)
🔍 Overview

This repository contains the solution for Task 7 of the Elevate AI & ML Internship. The objective of this task was to implement Support Vector Machines (SVM) for linear and non-linear classification, visualize decision boundaries, and tune hyperparameters for optimal performance.

📁 Dataset

For this task, the Breast Cancer Dataset was used. It contains features computed from digitized images of breast masses to predict whether they are benign or malignant.
